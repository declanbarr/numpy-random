# numpy-random
## An investigation into the numpy.random package

### What's contained in this repository

This repository contains the following files:

* numpy-random.ipynb 
* .gitignore
* LICENSE
* README.md

The numpy-random.ipynb file contains the analyses that was carried out into the numpy.random function.


### How to run the Jupyter Notebook

For this project I used Anaconda version 5.3 and Python version 3.6.7. Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of Python used for data science.[1] Anaconda provides a number of libraries. For this project I will be using the following libraries: Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib.

The numpy-random.ipynb file can be viewed in full on GitHub or can be downloaded and run on your PC. To run on your own machine follow these steps:

* Download the raw .ipynb file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/declanbarr/numpy-random/master/numpy-random.ipynb
* On the command line change directory into the directory where you saved the ipynb file
* Start jupyter notebook by typing: jupyter notebook

### Project plan

#### Updated Project Plan Friday 09/11/2018

Friday
* ~~Work on adding descriptions to remaining sections~~
* ~~Add code and descriptions to seeds~~

Saturday
* ~~Clean up code~~
* ~~Clean up descriptions ( add in proper referencing, etc)~~
* Finish Readme
* Add URL to Moodle page
* Review entire assignment (includes reading over PDF of assignment and rewatching video to ensure nothing has been missed)

Sunday
* Contingency day - Aim to have all work completed before this day

#### Previous Project Plan

Project contains 5 main sections:
* Purpose of numpy
* Simple Random Data
* Permutations
* Distributions
* Seeds

Distributions will most likely be the most time consuming.

Time will be multiplied by 0.67 to give time spent on Programming for Data Analysis the remaining 0.33 is to be spent on Fundamentals of Data Analysis.

From below there is a total of 53 hours to work on Programming for Data Analysis (61 hours if extra days off work are taken). 

Giving Distributions twice as much time as the other sections means that each section will have 53/6 = 9 hours to complete (Distributions will be 9 * 2 = 18 hours). Time will also need to be spent on course work - working through the new lessons. So this time is only the max time that can be spent.


__Saturday 27th to Sunday 28th (Full days) 16 hours * 0.67 = 11 Hours__

* Project plans
* Add sections into ipynb file
* Start Distributions


__Monday 29th to Tuesday 30th (Evenings only due to work) 4 hours * 0.67 = 3 hours__

* Continue Distributions


__Wednesday 31st to Sunday 4th (Full days due to holidays) 40 hours * 0.67 = 27 hours__

* By Wednesday be finished Distributions
* Wednesday start SimpleRandom Data - have this finished by Thursday
* Thursday start Permutations Finish Permutations on Friday
* Start Seeds on Saturday and be finished on Sunday


__Monday 5th to Friday 9th (Evenings only due to work - but may be able to take time off) 10 hours = 7 hours(with Thursday and Friday off this would be 22 hours for the week = 15 hours)__

* Start and finish purpose of Numpy


__Saturday 10th (Full day) 8 hours = 5 hours__

Finish assignment



__Sunday 11th__
Contingency Day - Aim to have assignment completed on Saturday or before.
